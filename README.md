## Free resources for learning about adsorption

- [Interactive Module](https://learncheme.com/quiz-yourself/interactive-self-study-modules/adsorption/adsorption-introduction/) 
  from University of Colorado Boulder: excellent resource containing videos of
  annotated lecture slides, simple equilibrium simulations and multiple choice questions.

## Adsorption data standardization

- [Adsorption Information Format](https://adsorptioninformationformat.com/): A
  universal file format for gas adsorption experiments, similar to a
  crystallographic CIF file.

## Databases of adsorption data

- [NIST ISODB](https://adsorption.nist.gov): A centralized database of pure and
  multicomponent adsorption isotherms from experimental published data.
- [Bison 20](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c05398?goto=supporting-info):
  A collection of multicomponent adsorption isotherms. Some has been integrated
  in the [NIST ISODB](https://adsorption.nist.gov).
- [MOFX-DB](https://mof.tech.northwestern.edu/): An online computational database for pure and multicomponent adsorption in MOFs and zeolites. 

## Adsorption data treatment and material characterization

- [pyGAPS](https://pygaps.readthedocs.io/): General purpose adsorption data
  treatment, characterization and isotherm fitting, including specific surface
  area, pore size distributions, isosteric enthalpy, isotherm model fitting and
  more.
- [pyGAPS-gui](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS-gui): Graphical user
  interface for [pyGAPS](https://pygaps.readthedocs.io/), offering interactive
  simple-to-use access to all its functionality.
- [BETSI-gui](https://github.com/fairen-group/betsi-gui): BET Surface
  Identification, an interactive graphical program for determining BET
  area using a statistical multiple region fit approach in combination with
  the Rouquerol criteria.
- [BEaTmap](https://github.com/PMEAL/beatmap): BET surface area analysis from
  adsorption data implementing the Rouquerol criteria and offering useful
  visualisations. An interactive Web App version exists allowing for easy use.
- [SESAMI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b02116), a script
  to estimate surface areas of porous materials using either/both the BET and
  excess sorption work model and later extended with machine learned (ML) estimations of monolayers as
  [SESAMI ML](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01518).
  One may find the interfaces from the Kulik group useful for the
  [web](https://github.com/hjkgrp/SESAMI_web) and for a
  [GUI](https://github.com/hjkgrp/SESAMI_GUI).
- [Micromeritics](https://github.com/Micromeritics/micromeritics)-provided
  various adsorption calculations and other support tools for their instruments.
- [pyPUC](https://github.com/sblanky/pyPUC): pyPUC (Python Porosity Uptake
  Correlator) determines the optimum pore size range of some type of material
  for gas uptake in a pressure range. The calculation uses experimental data
  and a brute force first principles calculation.
- [mofdscribe](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/mofdscribe): a package for generating features
  for MOFs. Allows access to over 40 featurizers via a simple python interface (including henry coefficient via RAPSA, geometric features via Zeo++).
  Also contains useful tools for ML model validation.
